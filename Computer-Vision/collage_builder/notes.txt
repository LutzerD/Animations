idea: create an image out of similiar smaller images
how?
	-Take n images (all unique?) from google search of keyword(s)
	-Take sub images from images (have a minimum resolution)
	-Shrink target picture to some small resolution, like 100xN
	-replace pixel with something else with roughly the same colour
